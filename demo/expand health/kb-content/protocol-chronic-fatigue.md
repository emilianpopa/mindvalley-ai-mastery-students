## Definition & Clinical Presentation

Chronic fatigue is persistent, unexplained tiredness lasting **≥6 months** that is not relieved by rest and significantly impacts daily functioning.

**Common Patient Complaints:**
- "I'm exhausted all the time, even after sleeping 8-9 hours"
- "I wake up tired and never feel refreshed"
- "I can barely make it through the workday without crashing"
- "I used to be energetic; now I have no motivation to exercise"
- "Brain fog and difficulty concentrating"

---

## Root Cause Assessment

Chronic fatigue is a **symptom**, not a diagnosis. Our approach identifies and addresses underlying causes:

### Common Contributing Factors

1. **Mitochondrial Dysfunction**
   - Impaired cellular energy (ATP) production
   - Oxidative stress damaging mitochondria
   - Nutrient deficiencies affecting electron transport chain

2. **Hormonal Imbalances**
   - Thyroid dysfunction (hypothyroidism, Hashimoto's, subclinical hypothyroidism)
   - Adrenal insufficiency or HPA axis dysregulation
   - Sex hormone imbalances (low testosterone, estrogen dominance)

3. **Nutritional Deficiencies**
   - Vitamin D (critical for energy and mood)
   - B vitamins (B12, folate, B6 - cofactors for energy metabolism)
   - Iron (anemia - most common reversible cause)
   - Magnesium (required for 300+ enzymatic reactions)
   - CoQ10, L-carnitine (mitochondrial function)

4. **Metabolic Dysfunction**
   - Insulin resistance and blood sugar dysregulation
   - Chronic inflammation
   - Poor glucose or ketone utilization

5. **Sleep Disorders**
   - Obstructive sleep apnea
   - Insomnia or poor sleep quality
   - Circadian rhythm disruption

6. **Chronic Infections & Immune Activation**
   - Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation
   - Other chronic viral infections
   - Gut dysbiosis and chronic low-grade inflammation

7. **Psychological & Lifestyle Factors**
   - Chronic stress and burnout
   - Depression and anxiety
   - Overtraining or insufficient recovery
   - Poor diet, sedentary lifestyle

- **Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) Panel:** IgG, IgM, EBNA (assess acute vs chronic infection)
- **Organic Acid Testing:** Mitochondrial markers, nutrient cofactors, neurotransmitters
- **CoQ10 levels**
- **Magnesium RBC** (more accurate than serum)
- **Omega-3 Index**
- **Sleep Study:** If snoring, observed apneas, or high BMI

### Clinical Assessment

## Evidence-Based Treatment Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation & Root Cause Correction (Weeks 0-6)

**Goal:** Identify and correct deficiencies, optimize sleep and lifestyle

#### 1. Nutritional Optimization

**Diet Principles:**
- Whole foods, nutrient-dense diet (eliminate processed foods)
- Balanced blood sugar (adequate protein, healthy fats, low glycemic carbs)
- Anti-inflammatory focus (Mediterranean-style)
- Hydration: 2-3L water daily

**Specific Recommendations:**
- Protein: 1.6g per kg body weight (supports muscle, neurotransmitters)
- Include omega-3 rich fish 2-3x per week
- Colorful vegetables (phytonutrients, antioxidants)
- Eliminate or minimize: refined sugar, alcohol, excessive caffeine

#### 2. Core Supplement Protocol

**Correct Identified Deficiencies:**

- **Vitamin D3:** 4000-10,000 IU daily (target blood level 50-80 ng/mL)
- **Vitamin B12:** 1000-2000mcg daily (methylcobalamin form preferred)
  - If severe deficiency: Consider B12 injections or sublingual
- **Iron (if deficient):** Ferrous bisglycinate 25-50mg daily
  - Take with vitamin C for absorption
  - Target ferritin >50 ng/mL (optimal 70-100 for energy)
  - Monitor: Can cause constipation
- **Magnesium Glycinate:** 400-600mg before bed
  - Supports energy production, sleep quality, stress resilience

**Mitochondrial Support (Core for Fatigue):**

- **CoQ10 (Ubiquinol):** 200-400mg daily
  - Essential for ATP production
  - Antioxidant, protects mitochondria
  - Evidence: Improves fatigue in multiple studies

- **L-Carnitine:** 1500-3000mg daily
  - Transports fatty acids into mitochondria for energy
  - Evidence: Reduces fatigue, improves exercise capacity

- **PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone):** 20mg daily
  - Supports mitochondrial biogenesis (creation of new mitochondria)
  - Neuroprotective

- **Alpha-Lipoic Acid (ALA):** 600mg daily
  - Antioxidant, supports mitochondrial function and glucose metabolism

**Adaptogenic & Energy Support:**

- **Rhodiola Rosea:** 300-600mg daily (morning)
  - Adaptogen: Reduces fatigue, improves stress resilience
  - Evidence: Effective for stress-related fatigue

- **Ashwagandha (KSM-66):** 300-600mg daily
  - Adaptogen: Supports HPA axis, reduces cortisol, improves energy
  - Take evening if using for sleep support

**Omega-3 (EPA/DHA):** 2000-3000mg daily
  - Anti-inflammatory, brain health, mood support

#### 3. Sleep Optimization (CRITICAL)

**Sleep Hygiene Protocol:**
- Consistent bed/wake times (even weekends)
- 7-9 hours nightly (non-negotiable)
- Cool, dark room (16-19°C)
- No screens 60-90 minutes before bed
- Avoid caffeine after 2pm
- Avoid alcohol (disrupts REM sleep)

**Supplement Support for Sleep:**
- Magnesium glycinate 400-600mg before bed
- Melatonin 1-5mg (short-term use, if needed)
- L-theanine 200mg (promotes relaxation)
- Consider CBD oil (if legal, patient interest)

**If Sleep Apnea Suspected:**
- Refer for sleep study
- CPAP therapy dramatically improves energy if OSA present

#### 4. Exercise (Paradoxical but Essential)

**Graduated Exercise Protocol:**

**Important:** Many fatigue patients feel worse with exercise initially. Start very conservatively and build slowly.

**Weeks 1-2:**
- 10-15 minute gentle walks daily
- Goal: Movement without exhaustion

**Weeks 3-4:**
- Increase to 20-30 minutes moderate walking
- Add gentle stretching or yoga 2x per week

**Weeks 5-6:**
- 30-40 minutes daily moderate activity
- Add 1-2x per week light resistance training
- Listen to body: Rest if post-exertional malaise occurs

**Evidence:** Regular moderate exercise improves mitochondrial function, mood, sleep quality, and energy over time.

#### 5. Stress Management

- **Daily breathwork or meditation:** 10-20 minutes
- **Sauna therapy:** 3-5x per week (see Expand Health protocols)
- **Nervous system regulation:** PEMF, HeartMath, vagal toning exercises
- **Time management:** Prioritize rest, say no to non-essential commitments

#### 6. Treat Underlying Conditions

**Thyroid Dysfunction:**
- If TSH >2.5 mIU/L with symptoms, consider thyroid hormone replacement or support
- Optimize with T4 (levothyroxine) or combination T4/T3 if needed
- Monitor Free T3, Free T4, symptoms

**Adrenal Support (if HPA axis dysfunction):**
- Adaptogens (rhodiola, ashwagandha)
- Stress reduction
- Consider hydrocortisone replacement in severe cases (rare, specialist-guided)

**Insulin Resistance:**
- Follow metabolic syndrome protocol
- Berberine, alpha-lipoic acid, time-restricted eating

### Phase 2: Advanced Therapies (Weeks 4-12)

**Goal:** Accelerate recovery with Expand Health clinic therapies

If foundational interventions provide partial improvement but patient still experiences significant fatigue, add advanced therapies.

#### NAD+ IV Therapy (PRIMARY INTERVENTION)

**Why NAD+ for Fatigue:**
- NAD+ is a critical coenzyme in cellular energy production
- Levels decline with age, stress, chronic illness
- IV administration bypasses digestion for maximum bioavailability
- Rapidly improves ATP production, DNA repair, mitochondrial function

**Protocol:**

- **Maintenance Phase:** Every 2-4 weeks as needed

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Significant energy improvement (often noticed by session 2-3)
- Enhanced mental clarity and focus
- Improved sleep quality
- Better stress resilience

**Patient Experience:**
- Session duration: 2-4 hours (slower infusion reduces side effects)
- Possible mild nausea, flushing during infusion (temporary, slow rate helps)
- Most patients report feeling "recharged" within 24-48 hours

**Evidence:**
- Clinical studies and extensive anecdotal evidence support NAD+ for chronic fatigue
- Safe, well-tolerated

#### Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT)

**Protocol:** 10-20 sessions over 4-8 weeks (2-3x per week)

**Why HBOT for Fatigue:**
- Increases oxygen delivery to tissues (including brain)
- Enhances mitochondrial ATP production

## Patient Education & Empowerment

### Key Concepts to Explain

**Fatigue is a Symptom, Not a Diagnosis:**
- We will identify and treat root causes, not mask symptoms
- Comprehensive approach addresses multiple contributing factors simultaneously

**Energy Restoration Takes Time:**
- Mitochondria take time to heal and regenerate
- Nutrient levels take weeks to optimize
- Lifestyle changes create cumulative benefits
- Patience and consistency are critical

**The Multi-System Approach:**
- No single intervention fixes chronic fatigue
- Nutrition, supplements, sleep, stress management, therapies all work together
- Each intervention addresses different underlying mechanisms

**Active Participation is Essential:**
- Patient compliance with lifestyle changes is the foundation
- Advanced therapies accelerate recovery but don't replace fundamentals
- Tracking symptoms helps identify what works

### Tools & Resources
- Energy and symptom tracking journal (daily 1-10 scale)
- Sleep tracking (app or journal)
- Nutrition and meal planning support
- Exercise progression guidelines
- Educational materials on mitochondrial health, adrenal function, etc.

## When to Refer or Escalate

- **No improvement after 12 weeks** despite comprehensive intervention → Consider specialist referral (endocrinology, rheumatology, infectious disease)
- **Worsening symptoms** or new concerning symptoms → Investigate further
- **Severe depression** or suicidal ideation → Mental health referral
- **Suspected chronic infection** (e.g., Lyme, mold toxicity) → Functional medicine specialist or infectious disease
- **Autoimmune markers** or complex medical history → Collaborate with specialists

## Doctor's Clinical Notes

**Patient Selection for Advanced Therapies:**
- Advanced therapies (NAD+, HBOT) are most effective after foundational deficiencies corrected
- High-yield interventions: NAD+ IV and red light therapy for mitochondrial support
- Budget-limited patients: Focus on Phase 1 + home red light therapy

**Compliance Factors:**
- Fatigue patients often feel overwhelmed; simplify recommendations
- Small wins early (e.g., sleep improvement, vitamin D correction) build momentum
- Regular check-ins and encouragement crucial

**Red Flags Requiring Further Investigation:**
- Rapidly progressive fatigue
- Weight loss, night sweats, fever → Malignancy, infection, autoimmune disease
- Severe muscle weakness → Neuromuscular disorder
- Cognitive decline → Dementia workup

**Follow-Up Priorities:**
1. Week 2: Check-in on supplement tolerance, sleep, initial energy changes
2. Week 6: Retest labs if initially abnormal, assess response
3. Week 12: Full reassessment, adjust protocol
4. Long-term: Transition to maintenance, prevent relapse
