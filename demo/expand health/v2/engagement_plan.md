# Engagement Plan for John Smith

A structured 4-week approach to implement the **Heavy Metal Detoxification and Hormonal Optimization Protocol** through WhatsApp support, focusing on gradual habit building and clinic integration. This plan follows the protocol's phased approach: Foundation first, then Enhanced Binding, then Intensive Chelation, and finally Recovery and Hormone Optimization.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation Building (Weeks 1-2)

*Establish tolerance, reduce risk, prevent overactivation*

### Supplements

- **Chlorella (broken cell wall)** - Take twice daily, 30 minutes before breakfast and dinner

- **Milk Thistle Extract (Silymarin)** - Take twice daily with meals

### Protocols

- **Hydration Protocol** - Maintain half body weight in ounces of filtered water daily; cease 2 hours before bed
- **Elimination Support Protocol** - Ensure daily bowel movement; morning routine with fiber if needed

### Client Actions

- [ ] Set up pill organizer with Foundation supplements
- [ ] Establish consistent morning and evening supplement timing
- [ ] Track daily water intake (target: half body weight in ounces)
- [ ] Monitor bowel movements daily; report if fewer than 1x/day
- [ ] Note any adverse reactions and report immediately

### Progress Goal

Complete 90% of prescribed supplements daily; achieve stable daily elimination; no adverse reactions to core protocol; adequate hydration tolerance.

## Phase 3: Intensive Chelation and Metabolic Optimization (Weeks 4-5)

*Prerequisite: Stable Phase 1 tolerance; Confirmed robust elimination; No adverse neurological symptoms*

### Supplements

**Continue all previous supplements, PLUS add:**

- **DMSA (2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid)** - Follow 3 days on, 11 days off cycling protocol as prescribed

- **Vitamin D3 + K2** - Take in the morning with fats
- **Berberine HCl** - Take twice daily before meals

### Clinic Treatments

- **IV Glutathione Push** - Schedule on **non-DMSA days only**; monitor respiratory status (per protocol)
