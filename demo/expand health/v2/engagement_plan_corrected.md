## 2) Engagement Plan Overview

### Purpose
This engagement plan translates John's clinical protocol into actionable weekly guidance. It ensures safe, phased implementation while preserving all clinical safeguards and progression logic.

### Clinical Authority
- The **Protocol document** is the clinical authority for dosages, timing, and medical decisions
- This engagement plan operationalizes the protocol but does NOT override clinical judgment
- All supplement dosages follow protocol specifications (referenced as "per protocol")

### How Progression Works
1. **Gates control advancement** - Client cannot proceed to next phase until gate conditions are met
2. **Gates are IF/THEN rules** - Not checklists; actual conditional logic
3. **Clinic treatments require eligibility** - Never default scheduled; always conditional on stability + absence of contraindications
4. **Tests trigger review cycles** - Schedule → Complete → Review with clinician → Adjust plan
