## 2. ENGAGEMENT PLAN OVERVIEW

### Purpose
This engagement plan **operationalizes** the clinical protocol. It translates clinical decisions into executable daily/weekly actions for the client and operations team.

### Authority
- **Protocol is the clinical authority** - this plan does not modify clinical decisions
- **Clinician owns all DECISIONS** - clinic treatments, escalations, protocol changes
- **Client executes ACTIONS** - supplements, hydration, lifestyle per protocol
- **Ops team facilitates** - scheduling, reminders, check-ins

### Conditional Progression
Advancement between phases is **governed by gates, tests, and clinician decisions**:
1. Gates must PASS before proceeding
2. Required tests must be COMPLETE and REVIEWED
3. Clinician must APPROVE advancement

### Communication Cadence
- **Channel:** WhatsApp
- **Frequency:** Every 3 days
- **Tone:** Encouraging and supportive
- **Escalation:** Within 24-48h for warning signs
