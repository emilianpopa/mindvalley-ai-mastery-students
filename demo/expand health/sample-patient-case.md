**Dr. Sarah:** Hi John, welcome to Expand Health. It's great to meet you. What brings you in today?

**John:** Thanks for seeing me, Dr. Sarah. Honestly, I'm at my wit's end. I've been exhausted for about six months now, and it's just getting worse. I used to be really active—I was running half marathons a few years ago—but now I can barely make it through the workday without feeling like I need to collapse.

**Dr. Sarah:** That sounds really frustrating, especially given how active you used to be. Tell me more about this fatigue. When do you notice it the most?

**John:** It's constant, really. I wake up tired even though I'm sleeping 7-8 hours. Well, I'm in bed for 7-8 hours, but I wake up 2-3 times a night. I never feel refreshed. By 2pm at work, I'm struggling to keep my eyes open. And forget about playing with my kids when I get home—I just crash on the couch.

**Dr. Sarah:** That must be hard on you and your family. How's your sleep quality overall? Any snoring or breathing issues that your wife has noticed?

**John:** She does mention that I snore pretty loudly. She's joked about kicking me out of the bedroom a few times. I don't think I stop breathing or anything, but I'm not sure. I just know I'm tossing and turning a lot.

**Dr. Sarah:** Okay, that's helpful. We might want to look into sleep apnea screening. Let me ask about other symptoms—have you noticed anything else besides the fatigue? Brain fog, mood changes, weight changes?

**John:** Oh yeah, brain fog for sure. I used to be sharp—I manage a whole finance team—but now I'm forgetting meetings, struggling to focus during presentations. It's embarrassing. As for weight, I've put on about 15 kilos in the past two years, mostly around my belly. I try to eat healthy—you know, salads for lunch—but I snack a lot at night. Carbs, mostly. Crackers, cereal, whatever's in the pantry.

**Dr. Sarah:** Night snacking is really common when we're tired and stressed. How are your stress levels?

**John:** Through the roof. I'm working 60-hour weeks minimum. The company's going through restructuring, and I'm under a lot of pressure. I feel like I'm barely keeping my head above water. My wife is supportive, but I feel guilty that I'm not present for her and the kids.

**Dr. Sarah:** That's a lot on your plate. How are you managing the stress? Any exercise, meditation, hobbies?

**John:** *laughs* Not really. I used to run, but my knees started hurting about a year ago, so I stopped. Now I'm pretty much sedentary—desk job, sitting most of the day. I keep telling myself I'll get back to it, but I'm just too tired.

**Dr. Sarah:** Understandable. Let me ask about your medical history. Any chronic conditions? What medications are you taking?

**John:** I'm on Lisinopril 10mg for blood pressure—been on that for about 3 years. I take a multivitamin, and sometimes ibuprofen for my knees. My doctor told me I'm pre-diabetic about two years ago. He put me on Metformin, but I stopped it after a few months because it gave me terrible stomach issues—nausea, diarrhea, the works.

**Dr. Sarah:** Got it. So you've tried Metformin but couldn't tolerate it. Have you had any recent blood work done?

**John:** Yeah, about two months ago. My GP said my cholesterol is high and my blood sugar is creeping up. He wants to put me on a statin, but honestly, I'm worried about side effects. My dad is on like 10 different medications for diabetes and heart disease, and I really don't want to go down that path. That's partly why I'm here—I want to try something different before I end up like him.

**Dr. Sarah:** I completely understand that concern. That's exactly what we do here—look at root causes and use advanced therapies alongside lifestyle changes to prevent that trajectory. Let me ask about your family history. What happened with your dad?

**John:** He has type 2 diabetes, diagnosed about 15 years ago. He's had a couple of heart stents, and he's on a ton of meds—metformin, statins, blood pressure pills, you name it. My mom has cardiovascular disease too—she had a mild heart attack a few years ago. So yeah, I'm pretty freaked out that I'm heading down the same road.

**Dr. Sarah:** That's important context. With that family history and your current symptoms, we definitely want to be proactive. What are your main goals here? What would success look like for you?

**John:** I want my energy back. I want to be able to play soccer with my kids without feeling like I'm going to keel over. I want to lose this belly fat and get back to a healthy weight. And honestly, I'd love to get off this blood pressure medication eventually and avoid adding more pills. I'm ready to do whatever it takes—I'm just tired of feeling like this.

**Dr. Sarah:** That's a great mindset. One more thing—I noticed you mentioned you're interested in some of our advanced therapies. What drew you to Expand Health specifically?

**John:** A colleague of mine came here a few months ago. He had similar issues—fatigue, metabolic stuff—and he raved about the hyperbaric chamber and the IV treatments. He said he felt like a new person after a few weeks. I looked into it and thought, why not? I can invest in my health now. My work schedule is pretty flexible, so I can do morning appointments, which I saw you offer.

**Dr. Sarah:** That's perfect. Morning appointments work really well for a lot of our therapies. And I'm glad you're open to exploring options like HBOT and IV therapy—they can be really powerful tools when combined with the foundational work. Do you have any concerns about costs or time commitment?

**John:** Not really. I mean, I want to be smart about it, but I can afford to invest in my health right now. Time-wise, mornings are best for me. I travel a bit for work—maybe once a month—but I can work around that.

**Dr. Sarah:** Excellent. Alright, based on everything you've told me, here's what I'm thinking. We're going to do a comprehensive blood panel—metabolic markers, lipids, inflammation, vitamins, hormones—to see what's going on under the hood. I also want to screen you for sleep apnea given the snoring and poor sleep quality. And then we'll put together a personalized protocol that addresses the fatigue, metabolic issues, and gets you back on track.

**John:** That sounds great. I'm ready to get started.

**Dr. Sarah:** Perfect. My team will get you set up for labs today, and we'll have results in about a week. Once I review everything, we'll create a detailed plan that includes nutrition, supplements, and likely some of our advanced therapies like HBOT and IV nutrients. How does that sound?

**John:** Sounds perfect. Thank you so much. I'm really hopeful.

**Dr. Sarah:** You should be. We've seen incredible results with cases like yours. We'll get you feeling better—I'm confident about that.
