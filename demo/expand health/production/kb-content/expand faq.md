Expand Health Cape Town – Frequently Asked Questions



What is Expand Health Cape Town?

Expand Health Cape Town is a longevity and health optimisation hub in De Waterkant.

We combine diagnostics, medical consultations, and advanced wellness therapies such as IV infusions, hyperbaric oxygen, red light therapy, sauna and cold exposure, PEMF, and nervous-system focused technologies.



Do I need a medical consultation before starting?

For basic wellness services like red light therapy, sauna, and some IV drips, you may not need a full consultation if you are generally healthy and complete our intake forms.

For more complex cases, chronic conditions, or medical protocols, a medical consultation with one of our doctors is required before starting.



What is the Health Insights assessment?

Health Insights is our entry assessment.

It may include body composition analysis, mineral and heavy metal screening, lifestyle review, risk factor assessment, and a discussion of your goals.

From this, we create a personalized protocol and decide whether you need further labs or a medical consult.



What therapies do you offer?

We offer a mix of medical and wellness modalities including:



IV nutrient therapy



Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT)



Red light therapy



Full-spectrum sauna and cold exposure



PEMF and nervous system regulation technologies



Breathwork and stress recovery tools



Medical and nutrition consultations

Availability may change over time; please contact us for the current menu.



Are the therapies safe?

All therapies have clear safety protocols and contraindications.

Before your first session we review your medical history and, where needed, get clearance from a doctor.

Certain conditions such as uncontrolled heart disease, pregnancy, recent surgery, or ear or sinus issues may limit which treatments are appropriate.



How do I book an appointment?

You can book via:



Our online booking system (link provided on our website and social channels)



WhatsApp or phone (clinic number)



Email (clinic email)

For first-time clients we recommend booking a Health Insights assessment or medical consultation.



Do you accept medical aid?

At this stage we operate as a cash-based practice.

We provide invoices so you can claim back from your medical aid where applicable, but reimbursement is at the discretion of your scheme.



How much do sessions cost?

Pricing depends on the specific service or protocol.

Examples: IV drips, hyperbaric oxygen sessions, and combined packages have different price points.

Because prices can change, please refer to our latest menu or contact the clinic directly for up-to-date rates.



Do you offer packages or memberships?

Yes. We offer protocol-based packages (for example Restore, Revitalize, and Regenerate levels) and memberships for people who want ongoing access to therapies each month.

These may include a set number of sessions per modality, member discounts, and check-ins with our team.



How long is a typical session?

It depends on the therapy:



IV drips: approximately 45–60 minutes



Hyperbaric oxygen: 60–90 minutes



Red light therapy: 10–20 minutes



Sauna and cold exposure: 30–45 minutes

We recommend arriving 10–15 minutes early for your first visit.



What is your cancellation policy?

We ask for at least 24 hours’ notice for cancellations or rescheduling.

Late cancellations and no-shows may be charged a fee or the full session rate.

Details are in our policies document.



Can I bring my children?

Our space is designed as a calm therapeutic environment.

Children are welcome if they have an appointment, but we do not provide childcare.

Please discuss in advance with our team if you need to bring a child with you.



Can I do multiple therapies in one visit?

Yes, many clients combine therapies (for example IV + red light, or sauna + cold plunge + recovery tech).

Our team will help you choose safe and effective combinations based on your goals and medical history.
