**Updated:** December 2025

---

## Overview & Goals

Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death globally. Our approach focuses on **prevention, early intervention, and optimization** rather than waiting for disease to develop.

**Target Populations:**
- Primary prevention (no existing CVD, reducing risk)
- Secondary prevention (history of CVD, preventing recurrence)
- Performance optimization (athletes, biohackers seeking peak cardiovascular function)
- Longevity focus (extending healthspan, protecting vascular health)

**Goals:**
- Reduce 10-year cardiovascular risk to <5% (low risk)
- Optimize lipid profile, blood pressure, inflammation markers
- Improve endothelial function and arterial compliance
- Enhance exercise capacity and cardiovascular fitness
- Support mitochondrial health and energy production

---

## Risk Assessment & Stratification

### Calculate 10-Year Cardiovascular Risk

Use validated risk calculators:
- **Framingham Risk Score**
- **ASCVD Risk Calculator** (American Heart Association / American College of Cardiology)
- **Reynolds Risk Score** (includes hsCRP and family history)

**Risk Categories:**
- **Low risk:** <5% 10-year risk
- **Intermediate risk:** 5-20% 10-year risk
- **High risk:** >20% 10-year risk or established CVD

### Non-Modifiable Risk Factors
- Age (men ≥45, women ≥55)
- Male sex
- Family history of premature CVD (men <55, women <65)
- Genetic factors (e.g., familial hypercholesterolemia, Lp(a) elevation)

### Modifiable Risk Factors
- Dyslipidemia (elevated LDL, low HDL, elevated triglycerides)
- Hypertension
- Smoking
- Diabetes / insulin resistance
- Obesity (especially visceral adiposity)
- Physical inactivity
- Poor diet
- Chronic stress
- Sleep disorders (especially obstructive sleep apnea)
- Chronic inflammation

## Diagnostic Workup

### Essential Labs (First-Line)
- **Lipid Panel (Advanced):**
  - Total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides
  - Non-HDL cholesterol
  - **ApoB (Apolipoprotein B):** Best predictor of cardiovascular risk
  - **Lp(a) - Lipoprotein(a):** Genetic risk factor (test once)
  - LDL particle number and size (NMR or ion mobility testing)

- **Glucose & Insulin:**
  - Fasting glucose, HbA1c
  - Fasting insulin (calculate HOMA-IR)

- **Inflammatory Markers:**
  - **hsCRP (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein):** <1.0 mg/L optimal
  - Consider: Fibrinogen, IL-6, oxidized LDL

- **Blood Pressure:** Multiple readings, assess for white coat hypertension
  - Consider 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring if borderline

- **Homocysteine:** Elevated levels increase CVD risk
  - Optimal: <10 µmol/L

- **Thyroid Panel:** TSH, Free T3, Free T4 (thyroid dysfunction affects CV risk)

- **Kidney Function:** eGFR, creatinine

### Advanced Diagnostics (Second-Line)
- **Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) Score:** CT scan to assess arterial calcification
  - Score of 0: Very low risk
  - 1-99: Mild risk
  - 100-399: Moderate risk
  - ≥400: High risk
  - Highly predictive, useful for risk stratification in intermediate-risk patients

- **Carotid Intima-Media Thickness (CIMT):** Ultrasound to assess subclinical atherosclerosis

- **Endothelial Function Testing:** Assesses vascular health (EndoPAT or brachial artery reactivity)

- **Omega-3 Index:** Target ≥8% (cardioprotective range)

- **Genetic Testing:** ApoE genotype, familial hypercholesterolemia screening

- **Advanced Imaging:** Cardiac MRI, CT angiography (if high risk or symptoms)

---

## Evidence-Based Intervention Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 0-8)

## Patient Education & Empowerment

### Key Concepts to Explain

**CVD is Preventable:**
- 80-90% of CVD is driven by modifiable risk factors
- Early intervention dramatically reduces lifetime risk
- Never too late to improve cardiovascular health

**Lifestyle is the Foundation:**
- Diet and exercise are more powerful than most medications
- Medications augment, not replace, lifestyle
- Consistency over time creates results

**Biomarkers Matter:**
- Track progress with labs
- Small improvements compound over time
- Optimize, don't just "normalize" (e.g., aim for LDL <70, not just <130)

**Longevity Mindset:**
- Cardiovascular health = healthspan and lifespan
- Invest now to prevent disease decades later
- Think in decades, not days

### Tools & Resources
- Nutrition and meal planning support
- Exercise programming (VO2max testing, heart rate zone training)
- BP and HRV tracking (wearables, apps)
- Educational materials on lipids, inflammation, endothelial function
- Community support (group exercise, accountability)

- **Chest pain, shortness of breath, syncope** → Immediate cardiology referral
- **Very high risk** (10-year risk >20% or established CVD) → Cardiology co-management
- **Resistant hypertension** (not controlled on 3 medications) → Specialist referral
- **Severe dyslipidemia** (LDL >190, TG >500, Lp(a) >150 nmol/L) → Lipid specialist
- **Genetic lipid disorders** (familial hypercholesterolemia) → Specialist management
- **Abnormal stress test or imaging** → Cardiology evaluation
