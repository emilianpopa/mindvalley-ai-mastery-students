**Created:** December 13, 2025
**Your Goal:** Working AI copilot prototype in 2 weeks

---

## 🎯 What I Built for You Today

### 1. Complete Clinical Protocols (Knowledge Base)
✅ [protocol-metabolic-syndrome.md](kb-content/protocol-metabolic-syndrome.md) — Complete treatment protocol
✅ [protocol-chronic-fatigue.md](kb-content/protocol-chronic-fatigue.md) — Energy restoration protocol
✅ [protocol-cardiovascular-health.md](kb-content/protocol-cardiovascular-health.md) — CV optimization protocol

**These contain:**
- Evidence-based interventions
- ExpandHealth therapy protocols (HBOT, IV, NAD+, red light, sauna, peptides)
- Supplement recommendations
- Expected outcomes and timelines
- Safety considerations

### 2. SUGAR Agent Prompt
✅ [prompts/agents/sugar-agent-expandhealth.md](../../prompts/agents/sugar-agent-expandhealth.md)

**This is the "brain" of your AI copilot:**
- Analyzes patient data
- Generates personalized treatment plans
- Integrates ExpandHealth therapies
- Uses your brand voice
- Includes safety guidelines

### 3. Sample Patient Case
✅ [sample-patient-case.md](sample-patient-case.md) — John Smith (45M, metabolic syndrome + chronic fatigue)

**Perfect for testing:**
- Complete conversation transcript
- Full lab results
- Patient goals and psychosocial context
- This is what the AI will analyze to generate plans

### 4. Implementation Guide
✅ [README.md](README.md) — Step-by-step setup instructions

**Your roadmap for the next 2 weeks:**
- Prerequisites checklist
- Week-by-week plan
- How we'll work together

## ⏭️ Next Steps (In Order)

### Step 1: Gather API Keys (Do This First)
You need accounts and API keys for:

- [ ] **N8N Cloud** — [n8n.io](https://n8n.io) — $20/month
- [ ] **Claude API** — [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) — Pay-per-use
- [ ] **Gemini API** — [aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) — Free
- [ ] **OpenAI API** — [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com) — Pay-per-use

**Once you have these, tell me and I'll start building workflows.**

---

### Step 2: I Build Gemini Knowledge Base Setup
**What I'll create:**
- Script to upload all protocols to Gemini File Search
- Test script to verify retrieval works
- Documentation for you

**What you'll do:**
- Run the script with your Gemini API key
- Verify protocols are uploaded
- Test a sample query

**Time:** 1-2 hours

---

### Step 3: I Build N8N Workflows (One by One)
**Week 1:**
- Agent 1: Audio → Patient Context (N8N workflow JSON)
- Agent 2: PDF → Lab Analysis (N8N workflow JSON)
- Agent 3: Clinical Reasoning (N8N workflow JSON)

**Week 2:**
- Agent 4: Protocol Matching with RAG (N8N workflow JSON)
- Master Orchestrator: Full end-to-end workflow
- Simple upload interface (HTML form)

**What you'll do:**
- Import each workflow into your N8N instance
- Add your API keys to N8N credentials
- Test each workflow as I build it
- Give me feedback

**Time:** 1 workflow per day, test as we go

---

### Step 4: End-to-End Testing
**What we'll test:**
- Upload John Smith's conversation + labs
- AI generates complete treatment plan
- You review for clinical accuracy
- Measure time savings

**Success = Plan that's clinically sound and takes <5 min to generate**

**Time:** 2-3 days of testing and refinement
