Hey [CLIENT NAME],

Thanks for reaching out – really glad you're exploring this.

So here's the thing: most people start with Health Insights because it gives us a clear baseline. We're looking at your minerals, body composition, energy systems, HRV – the foundational stuff that tells us what's actually happening in your body right now.

From there, we'd typically recommend starting with Restore if you're looking to build that foundation – sleep, energy, recovery. It's 1-2 sessions a week, and we use modalities like red light, PEMF, sauna, compression. Nothing intense, just consistent support for your body to start functioning better.

If you're dealing with more specific metabolic or inflammatory issues, we might recommend Revitalize instead – that adds IV therapy and HBOT, plus health coaching. But let's start with the assessment and see what your data tells us.

Does that make sense? Happy to jump on a quick call if it helps.

Best,
Emilian
