Dear Saskia, dear Nefertiti,

To help you move things forward, I'm sharing the first set of assets now. I'll add the remaining items once we clarify the activation format so everything is aligned and consistent.

**Recipient:** William Hamilton Shipp IV <william.shipp@berkeley.edu>
**Context:** Client Health Consultation

Hi Will,

Thanks again for sending all the info — really helpful context and clearly a lot of work has gone into building the facility and unlocking the insurance side.

Looking forward to our call later today. A few areas I'd love to explore to better understand the path forward:

- What's the current burn rate and cash runway?
- How are you structuring the reimbursement model — e.g. CPT codes, timeline from treatment to payment, and historical denial rates?
- Can you break down the $3.5M capital need into its components (OpEx, construction, AR buffer, etc.)?
- What's current chamber utilization, and what's your target to reach breakeven?
- How scalable and repeatable is the recent urology referral traction?
- What's the fallback plan if you only raise $1.5M — can that get you to breakeven?

## Sample 2.1: Longevity
**Date:** 4d ago
**Platform:** LinkedIn
**Engagement:** 0 likes, 2 comments
**Topic:** Longevity

I've been experimenting with something simple that made a huge difference: swapping sugar for allulose.

I don't eat much sugar anyway, but we make homemade ice cream at home, and I love to try a bit, 2-3 times a week, after breakfast. Even that small amount was enough to spike my glucose (we mix protein and collagen powder, fresh berries and coconut cream)

So I measured it. First with regular sugar, then again after switching to allulose.

The difference was dramatic.

Same recipe. Same portion. Totally different glucose response.

And I have to thank Dr. Guénolé Addor, MD, we spoke about this in London two weeks ago, and your LinkedIn post pushed me to test it properly. The data speaks for itself.

For anyone curious: allulose tastes almost identical to sugar, and for me, it's become a game-changer.

## Sample 2.2: TMS
**Date:** 5d ago
**Platform:** LinkedIn
**Engagement:** 0 likes, 12 comments
**Topic:** TMS

Most people still think TMS is a niche therapy. But every week, I'm seeing how life-changing it can be.

Over the past months, I've spoken with friends, clients, and practitioners across Europe and North America who've used Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) for very different reasons — depression, anxiety, ADHD, chronic pain, PTSD, even fibromyalgia. And the pattern is the same: deeper calm, less pain, more clarity, better emotional stability.

In Bucharest, our friends at BTL Industries (Exomind) told me about clients who regained focus after years of cognitive fatigue. A US + Canadian team called Ampa Health showed me a portable device that people use daily at home, not just few times in a clinic. And in London, Dr Alberto Pertusa, who is deeply immersed in TMS research, explained the science behind it all.

## Sample 2.3: biohacking
**Date:** 6d ago
**Platform:** LinkedIn
**Engagement:** 0 likes, 4 comments
**Topic:** biohacking

A few years ago, startups were raising millions to build applications.

Today, you can build them in one afternoon, and they already do 80% of the job.

Over the past weeks, thanks in large part to what I learned in the Mindvalley AI Mastery, I've been testing how far you can go by combining AI with simple no-code tools.

The result surprised even me: in just hours, I've built several micro-apps that I now use daily.

• MealTracker – a lightweight nutrition app I built in under an hour to log my meals and track macros for my high-protein, high-fat, low-carb diet (which I monitor with my Lumen).

• CleanScan – snap a photo of any supermarket product, grocery item, or beauty product and get an instant health rating (a simple, fast EWG-style experience).

• Expand Health prototypes – from biohacking dashboards to client intake flows.

## Sample 2.4: Longevity
**Date:** 1w ago
**Platform:** LinkedIn
**Engagement:** 0 likes, 11 comments
**Topic:** Longevity

Three years ago, a single test flipped my understanding of my health on its head.

I remember opening my first GlycanAge report and reading that my biological age was dramatically higher than my real age.

I didn't expect that.

I thought I was doing "okay": training, eating well enough, building companies, pushing through fatigue like everyone else.

But the data told a different story.

Chronic inflammation.

Accelerated biological aging.

A body under far more stress than I realized.

That test became a turning point.

Not in a dramatic, overnight way, more in the quiet, uncomfortable realization that nothing changes unless you measure, track, and act.

Since then, I've rebuilt so many foundations:

better sleep, deeper stress management, cellular repair protocols, anti-inflammatory nutrition, consistent recovery.

## Sample 2.5: CapeTownTechWeek
**Date:** 1w ago

**Topic:** CapeTownTechWeek

I do the same every time I fly — long-haul trips, conferences, disrupted sleep. I always use a mix of hydration, NAD+, red light, HBOT, ice plunge, whatever I have access to, even when I'm travelling with my own gear.

For everyone landing in Cape Town for the investor and tech events, Jack and the team put together a great recovery menu at our Expand Health De Waterkant space. If you need a quick reset between meetings or after the flight, this is the place.
