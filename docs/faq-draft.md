# Expand Health – Frequently Asked Questions

## FAQ: Getting Started

**Q: How do I begin my longevity journey with Expand Health?**

A: Every client begins with a Health Insights assessment, which includes Oligoscan, InBody composition, BioWell energy assessment, and lifestyle intake. This gives us a clear understanding of your biology. From there, we create a personalized protocol tailored to your goals—whether that's foundational recovery, metabolic optimization, or advanced regeneration.

## FAQ: Locations & Access

**Q: Where are your clinics located?**

A: We currently operate two longevity hubs:
- **Cape Town, South Africa** – De Waterkant (HBOT, IV therapy, red light, PEMF, cryo, sauna, medical consultations, coaching)
- **Bucharest, Romania** – Aviatorilor Boulevard (longevity medical, esthetics, diagnostics, biohacking, IV therapy)

Additional territories in Asia and the Middle East are under development.

## FAQ: Protocol Options

**Q: What are the different protocol tiers and how do I choose?**

A: We offer three tiers based on your goals and time commitment:
- **Restore** (1-2 sessions/week): Foundational recovery, detox, sleep, energy
- **Revitalize** (2-3 sessions/week): Adds IV therapy, HBOT, health coaching for metabolic health and inflammation
- **Regenerate** (3-4 sessions/week): Advanced medical therapies, peptides, neurotherapies for performance and accelerated recovery

Your protocol is personalized based on your diagnostics and consultation with our clinicians.

## FAQ: Medical Oversight

**Q: Are your treatments medically supervised?**

A: Yes. All medical procedures are supervised by licensed physicians. We follow IFM (Institute for Functional Medicine) standards and conventional medical safety norms. Diagnostic interpretation is conducted only by qualified clinicians, and informed consent is mandatory before any medical intervention.

## FAQ: Technology & AI

**Q: How does Expand Labs AI work?**

A: Expand Labs is our proprietary AI platform that powers diagnostic interpretation, generates personalized protocols, manages patient engagement, and runs clinic operations (CRM, bookings, workflows). The AI analyzes your diagnostic data and creates actionable health insights, which are then reviewed and refined by our medical team.
